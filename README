* something that returns the current time as a value of type 'time'.

* a 'bless_html' function, that takes a string, and checks that it is valid, and then returns the result of parsing the XML/HTML contained within that string.

* When getting column names wrong, error messages are pretty unhelpful.

* md5 or sha1 function, defined at least on strings (but preferably over all types!)
